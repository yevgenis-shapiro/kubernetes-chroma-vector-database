## Chroma | Kubernetes ☸️
ChromaDB (often just called Chroma) is an open-source embedding database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector data efficiently. It’s commonly used in AI/ML applications, particularly for vector search, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.


#### 🎯 Key Features:

- **⚡ Vector storage & indexing**: Optimized for nearest-neighbor searches.
- **🔌 Python-first API**: Easy to integrate with Python ML/AI workflows.
- **🔍 Persistent storage**: Can store vectors on disk for long-term use.
- **🤖 Multi-modal support**: Can handle embeddings from text, images, or other data types.
